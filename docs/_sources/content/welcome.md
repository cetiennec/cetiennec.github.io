# Sustainability in High School Mathematics

% NOTE: Could do quizzes via https://github.com/jmshea/jupyterquiz
% Also: https://jmshea.github.io/Foundations-of-Data-Science-with-Python/intro.html
% Idea: make different notebooks for theory and implementation to avoid cluttering (use sections)
% Chapter 8 is next

Welcome to the open-source project about **sustainability in high school mathematics**! We are happy that you have 
decided to give our project a try. 

**TODO: Give a description of the project, it's origin, and it's goals, it's target audience**

The book itself has been created with the help of many {doc}`maintainers and contributors <./credits>`.

```{tip}
As a **teacher**, you do not need to have any experience with programming to use the book! We have made it 
**easy-to-use**, and have released a {doc}`user guide <./user_guide>` over here. Do not worry! It is easy to use and you
will be able to get started **within a minute**!
```

following topics have been added to the book:
